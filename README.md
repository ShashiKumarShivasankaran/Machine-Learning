# Machine-Learning

1. *Machine Learning Overview:*
   - Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.
   - It involves the use of statistical techniques to empower systems to improve their performance on a specific task over time, allowing them to make predictions, classifications, or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

2. *Key Machine Learning Algorithms:*
   - *Supervised Learning Algorithms:* These algorithms learn from labeled training data, making predictions or classifications based on input-output pairs. Examples include linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
   - *Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:* These algorithms work with unlabeled data, identifying patterns or relationships without predefined outputs. Clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) and dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) are common examples.
   - *Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:* These algorithms involve an agent learning from interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning methods, such as deep Q networks (DQN), fall into this category.
   - *Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning:* These approaches lie between supervised and unsupervised learning, using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data or leveraging the structure within the data itself for learning.
   - *Ensemble Learning:* Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are popular ensemble techniques.
   - *Deep Learning:* Neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) are a subset of machine learning known for their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data are examples.
