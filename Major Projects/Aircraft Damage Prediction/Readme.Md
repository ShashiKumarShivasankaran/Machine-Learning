ABOUT PROJECT
- The aviation accident database synopses project, known as Aviation Data, is a comprehensive collection of data related to aviation accidents worldwide, providing detailed information and analysis to enhance safety and understanding within the aviation industry.
- The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.
- The NTSB is an independent federal agency in the United States responsible for investigating transportation 
  accidents, including those involving aviation.
OBJECTIVE
- The objective of the project on Aviation Accident Damage from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is to thoroughly investigate and analyze aviation accidents in order to understand the causes and consequences of these incidents.
    - Determine if there are any specific plane models or engine types that exhibit a higher level of risk or danger 
      in terms  of flight safety.

    - Investigate the weather conditions that have contributed to aviation accidents, aiming to understand the 
      specific factors  that lead to these incidents. 

    - Analyze the correlation between the number of engines on an aircraft and the likelihood of survivability, with 
      the goal  of determining if a higher number of engines leads to increased safety.

    - Assess which phase of a flight poses the highest level of risk or danger, considering factors such as takeoff, 
      climb,  cruise, descent, or landing.
